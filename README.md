# Miyawaki Forest Home Planner
Live Link: https://miyawaki-forest-home.vercel.app/

A comprehensive web application for planning and designing Miyawaki food forests, specifically tailored for Bangladesh's climate and native species. This tool helps users create dense, biodiverse forest ecosystems around their homes following the proven Miyawaki methodology.

## 🌳 About Miyawaki Method

The Miyawaki method creates native forests that grow 10x faster and become 30x denser than conventional plantations. This application helps you plan a complete food forest ecosystem with proper species selection, spacing, and cost analysis.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌱 **Species Management**
- Pre-loaded database of 50+ native Bangladesh species
- 4-layer forest structure (Canopy, Sub-canopy, Shrub, Ground)
- Real-time plant count adjustments
- Species-specific information (height, fruiting time, harvest months)

### 📈 **Harvest Timeline**
- 10-year fruiting projection chart
- Monthly harvest calendar
- Production timeline from immediate to long-term yields

### 💰 **Cost Analysis**
